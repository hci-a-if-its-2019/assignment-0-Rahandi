## Github
### No button to add new branch
This is my experience, when i'm on a project and i need to create a new branch without using git bash i find it difficult to know how to create a new branch, i have to google it before i knew how to create a new branch

### Sugestions
Add a button to create a new branch, for user who's not often on using github, this will be a great help
